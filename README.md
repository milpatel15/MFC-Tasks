**LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**
The Library Management System is a simple command-line-based application that allows users to manage books using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 
The system is implemented using Python and uses a dictionary to store books with their ISBN numbers as keys.
The reason to use dictionary is that dictionary has keys which are unique so I can use ISBN numbers as keys.
Functions
🔹 create() – Adds a new book.
🔹 read() – Reads and displays a book’s title by ISBN.
🔹 update() – Updates the title of an existing book.
🔹 delete() – Removes a book from the system.
🔹 main() – Displays the menu and runs the program loop.

**Sorting Algorithm**
This project implements and compares the performance of four sorting algorithms:
✔️ Bubble Sort
✔️ Selection Sort
✔️ Insertion Sort
✔️ Custom Sorting Algorithm (mysorting)

Each algorithm sorts a list of random numbers and measures execution time to analyze efficiency.
